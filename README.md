# Personal Avatar Profile - [DEMO](https://laurelinep.github.io/AvatarProfile/)

<img src="./avatar-css.gif" height="450" alt="Avatar GIF" style="margin: 0 35%">

Haven't you notice how a representationnal picture is requested ?  
( resumes, linkedIn, forums, etc... ) Let's agree to disagree on this one !

As a **creative developper**, I wanted to represent myself  
using my coding skills using only **HTML & CSS** ( preprocessed with SCSS ).

Maybe will do more features later on.
